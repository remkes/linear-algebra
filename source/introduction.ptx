    <title>Themes of Linear Algebra</title>
    <p>
      Most students entering this course will have experience with
      high school mathematics and first year calculus (and maybe a
      smattering of other experienes, such as statistics). Linear
      algebra is not only a new topic in mathematics; compared to
      these previous experiences, it involves a substantially new way
      of thinking. In this introduction, I want to briefly lay out the
      main themes and ideas that I'll be working through for the
      entire term. I encourage you to keep these ideas in the back of
      your head and notice how the material of the course builds up
      these theme.
    </p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>
        <em>Geometry and Algebra</em>. Much of modern mathematics is
        based on the cartesian coordinate system. The major strength
        of this system is that is builds a connection between geometry
        and algebra. Shapes are connected to their equations, so that
        you want determine the properties of shapes by working with
        those equations. Likewise, equations can be interpreted as
        shapes, so that you can use geometry to visualize what is
        happening in algebra. In calculus, this happened through
        graphs: a graph was a geometric visualization of the behaviour
        of a function. Linear algebra continues to build on this
        connection, though the specific types of geometry and
        equations are different from calculus. All of the equations
        and algebraic manipulation in the course can be visualized
        geometrically and, likewise, all of the geometry in the course
        can be accessed algebraically. Though it is called an
        <sq>algebra</sq> course, this is as much a geometry course as
        anything. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Flatness</em>. If linear algebra is a geometry course,
        what kind of geometry does it do? It does flat geometry:
        straight lines, planes, flat surfaces, and higher dimensional
        analogues. Flat objects are inherently more accessible and
        understandable than more complicated curved objects, so they
        are a natural start to geometry. Much of more complicated
        geometry is built on the linear algebra foundation of flat
        geometry. It's a natural place to start. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Linearity</em>. In geometry, the word <sq>linearity</sq>
        refers to lines, which fits with the previous point about flat
        objects. However, the word also has another important meaning
        in algebra: an operation or structure is <term>linear</term>
        if it interacts well with addition, subtraction and
        multiplication by constants. That's a bit vague for now, but
        I'll be developing this idea in detail over the course. From
        the algebriac side, this course is about understanding how
        these linear operations behave and what they can and cannot do.
        And, of course, the geometric linear and the algebraic linear
        do match up with each other.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Symmetry</em>. In ordinary usage, a symmetry is a change of
        a shape that preserves it, like a reflection. The mathematical
        notion is similar, but not precisely the same. If I have a
        transformation (such as a reflection), its symmetries are
        the things its preserves. I've just flipped the definition
        here: in conventional usage, the shape has a symmetry, but in
        mathematical usage, the transformation (the reflection) has
        the symmetry. Mathematically, whenever I define some kind of
        transformation, I want to ask for its symmetries: for what is
        preserves. If can preserve shapes, and I will talk about that
        in detail. But it can also preserve other mathematical
        structures, particularly algebraic structures. to study
        symmetry is to ask, for a mathematical operation: what is
        preserved? Asking this quesiton can build a deep 
        understanding of the transformation. I'll keep coming back to
        this question of what is perserved throughout the course.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Definition, Rigor and Proof</em>. Mathematics is a formal
        language, with strict rules about logic, definition and
        arguments. Your mathematical education to date has included
        this formalization, but this course represents a substantial
        step up in commitment to that formalization. All the
        definitions in the course will be given in mathematically
        formal language. I will try to provide proofs for many of the
        statements. I'll also ask you to try to write proofs in your
        exercises and assignments. I'll try to convince you that
        writing proofs, along side doing calculations or solving
        problems, is <sq>doing mathematics</sq>. 
      </li>

    <title>Mathematical Thinking and Writing</title>
    <p>
      The themes listed above are the content goals I have for the
      course. However, in addition to the content of linear algebra
      itself, I want to focus on the more general skills of
      mathematical thinking and writing. I'm going to present material
      more formally and expect a higher standard of formal writing
      from you. A large part of learning mathematics is being
      apprenticed into the way that mathematics is written and, evern
      more so, the way that mathematics is thought. This is a much
      trickier task than just learning how to do problems: it's
      learning a style, not an algorithm. It's learning a way of
      thinking, not just an individual fact. As challening as it is,
      working on thinking and writing is a major goal of this course.
      I hope you buy into this challenge, that you consciously work on
      your mathematical writing and thinking. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the undergraduate mathematics courses, linear algebra is the
      most natural place to start talking about mathematical proofs
      and to work on formalized mathematical writing. The material
      lends itself to a number of accessible proof examples and have a
      level of abstraction that suits proof questions. The linear
      algebra course also serves as a prerequisite for most of the
      other mathematic courses where proof becomes quite important,
      including the senior calculus courses, discrete mathematics,
      abstract algebra, cryptography and theory of computing.
