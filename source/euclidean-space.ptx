      Euclidean or cartesian space is the environment for this course.
      The cartesian plane is familiar to you, but I'm going to give
      formal definitions regardless. This is part of the process of
      learning the formal language of mathematics: of taking
      previously known mathematical ideas and redefining them in more
      formal, logical ways. We start that process with geometric space
      and the vectors therein.

          In linear algebra and many other brances of mathematics,
          ordinary numbers (integers, rational numbers or real
          numbers) are called <term>scalars</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>vector</term> is a finite ordered list of scalars.
          Vectors can be written either as columns or rows. If a
          vector is a list of the numbers <m>4</m>, <m>15</m>,
          <m>\pi</m> and <m>-e</m> (in that order), I write the
          vector in one of two ways:
          <md>
           <mrow>
             \amp \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 15 \\ \pi \\ -e \end{pmatrix} 
             \amp \text{or} \amp \amp (4, 15, \pi, -e) \amp
            </mrow>.
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In this course, I will exclusively use column vectors. In many
      other places, row vectors are common. I find it best to choose
      one of the two for the whole course instead of switching back
      and forth. For reason that I'll talk about in future weeks,
      column vectors are a good choice for this course. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer. <term>Real Euclidean
          Space</term> or <term>Cartesian Space</term>, written
          <m>\RR^n</m>, is the set of all vectors of length <m>n</m>
          with real number entries. I write an arbitrary vector with
          coefficients <m>x_i</m> as follows. 
          <me>
            \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since there are <m>n</m> coefficients in its vectors, the
          space <m>\RR^n</m> has <term>dimension</term> <m>n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Two dimensional space, <m>\RR^2</m>, and possibly three
      dimensional space, <m>\RR^3</m>, should be familiar. Notice,
      though, that my new formal definitions work in any dimension.
      This is the power of mathematical abstraction and formalization.
      Even though we live in three dimensions and can't visualize
      higher dimension, there are many reasons (including very
      practical reasons) to consider higher dimensions. Therefore, my
      definitions are flexible enough to consider four dimension
      space, or six dimension vectors, or whatever else I need. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The scalars <m>x_i</m> in a vector are called the
          <term>entries</term>, <term>coordinates</term> or
          <term>components</term> of that vector. Specifically,
          <m>x_1</m> is the first coordinate, <m>x_2</m> is the second
          coordinate, and so on. For <m>\RR^2</m>, <m>\RR^3</m> and
          <m>\RR^4</m>, I use the letters <m>w,x,y,z</m> instead of
          <m>x_i</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \amp \in \RR^2 \amp
              \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y\\ z \end{pmatrix} \amp \in \RR^3
              \amp \begin{pmatrix} w \\ x\\ y\\ z \end{pmatrix} \amp
              \in \RR^4
            </mrow>

        <p>
          In any <m>\RR^n</m>, the <term>origin</term> is the unique
          point given by a vector of zeros. It is also called the
          <term>zero vector</term>. It is considered the centre point
          of Euclidean space.

      This is geometry, so I want to actully see it. Euclidean space
      is usually visualized by drawing axes, one in each independent
      perpendicular direction. In this visualization, the vector
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}</m> corresponds to the
      unique point I get moving <m>a</m> units in the direction of the
      <m>x</m> axis and <m>b</m> units in the direction of the
      <m>y</m> axis. <xref ref="figure-points-in-the-cartesian-plane"
      /> shows the location of several points in <m>\RR^2</m>.

      As with <m>\RR^2</m>, the point <m> \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c
      \end{pmatrix} \in \RR^3</m> is the unique point I find by
      moving <m>a</m> units in the <m>x</m> direction, <m>b</m> units
      in the <m>y</m> direction and <m>c</m> units in the <m>z</m>
      direction. When visualizing <m>\RR^2</m>, the convention is to 
      draw the <m>x</m> axis horizontally, with a positive direction
      to the right, and the <m>y</m> axis vertically, with a positive
      direction upwards. For <m>\RR^3</m>, the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>
      axes form a flat plane, and the <m>z</m> axis extends vertically
      from that plane.  <xref ref="figure-points-in-three-space" />

        <p>
          Note that I needed to choose directions for the axes in
          both <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m>. In a visualization of
          Euclidean space, there are no predetermined directions for
          axes. I have to make a choice. This choice of axis
          directions in the visualization of <m>\RR^n</m> is called 
          <term>orientation</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      While I can visualize <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m> relatively
      easily and efficiently, I can't visualize any higher
      <m>\RR^n</m>. However, this doesn't prevent me from working in
      higher dimensions. I need to rely on the algebraic
      descriptions of vectors instead of the drawings and
      visualizations of <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m>. This is where
      the algebra/geometry connection becomes truly remarkable: if I
      build the algebra to describe two and three dimensional
      geometry, I can use that algebra to describe four, five and
      higher dimensional geometry as well. Even though I can't see
      these spaces, I can understand them and work with them. It's
      amazing. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the visualizations of <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m>, I see
      the different axes as fundamentally different perpendicular
      directions. I can think of <m>\RR^2</m> as the space with two
      independent directions and <m>\RR^3</m> as the space with three
      independent directions. Similarly, <m>\RR^4</m> is the space
      with four perpendicular, independent directions, even though it
      is impossible to visualize such a thing. Likewise, <m>\RR^n</m>
      is the space with <m>n</m> independent directions.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-point-or-directions">
    <title>Points or Directions?</title>
    <p>
      I can think of an element of <m>\RR^2</m>, say
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}</m> , as both the point
      located at <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}</m> and the
      vector drawn from the origin to the point <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1
      \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}</m> , as shown in <xref
      ref="figure-points-and-directions" />. Though these two ideas
      are distinct, I will frequently switch between them, often
      without explicitly saying so. Part of becoming proficient in
      vector geometry is becoming accustomed to the switch between the
      perspectives of points and directions.

    <title>Local Direction Vectors</title>
    <p>
      I've already spoken about the distinction between elements of
      <m>\RR^n</m> as points and vectors. There is another important
      subtlety that shows up all throughout vector geometry. In
      addition to thinking of vectors as directions starting at the
      origin, I can think of them as directions starting anywhere in
      <m>\RR^n</m>. I call these <term>local direction vectors</term>.

    </figure>
    <p>
      <xref ref="figure-local-direction-vectors" /> shows local
      direction vectors starting at the point <m>\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\
      2 \end{pmatrix} \in \RR^2</m>. The two local vectors
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}</m> and
      <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}</m> are relative to
      the point <m>\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \in \RR^2</m>
      as if that were their origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using vectors to define local directions is a useful tool. A
      standard example is a camera in a three-dimensional virtual
      environment. First, I need to know the location of the camera,
      which is an ordinary vector starting from the origin. Second, I
      need to know what direction the camera is pointing, which is a
      local direction vector which treats the camera location as the
      current origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most difficult things about learning vector geometry
      is becoming accustomed to local direction vectors. I won't
      always carefully distinguish between vectors at the origin and
      local direction vectors; often, the difference is implied, and it
      is up to the reader/student to figure out how the vectors are
      being used.
