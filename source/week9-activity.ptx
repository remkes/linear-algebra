      <statement>
        <p>
          Make a multiplication table for the dihedral group
          <m>D_5</m>. (Label the rotations <m>R_i</m>; the index
          <m>i</m> indicates how many fifth of a full turn for the
          rotation. Label the reflections <m>F_i</m>; the index
          indicates reflection over a line through the <m>i</m>
          vertex, counting counterclockwise.)

        <p>
          There are many multiplications to calculate. I recommend
          calculating matrices by vertex operations. If I number the
          vertices of the pentagon counterclockwise from 1 to 5, then
          <m>R_2</m> (rotation by <m>\frac{2}{5}</m> of a turn) can be
          represented by this movement of vertices.

          Reflection <m>F_3</m> (reflection over the line through
          vertex 3 and the middle of the opposite edge)) can be
          represented by this action on the vertices.

          To calculate <m>R_2 \circ F_3</m>, I can use these vertex
          changes. In composition, I do the right transformation
          first. Therefore, starting at vertex 1, <m>F_3</m> send it
          to vertex 5, and then <m>R_2</m> sends vertex 5 to vertex 2.
          Therefore, the whole composition sends vertex 1 to vertex 2.
          I calculate the movement of the other four vertices
          similarly.

          Then I have to identify this transformation, since is still
          should be something in the group. It cannot be a rotation,
          since vertex 4 is fixed. The only rotation that fixes vertex
          4 is <m>F_4</m>. Therefore, I have <m>R_2 \circ F_3 =
          F_4</m>. Note that the multiplication is not commutative. If
          I did <m>F_3 \circ R_2</m>, the result would be these vertex
          transformations.

          This is the reflection <m>F_2</m>, so <m>F_3 \circ R_2 =
          F_2</m>.  Using similar vertex calcluation for all the
          entries, I produce the following multiplication table for
          <m>D_5</m>.

    <title>Proof Questions</title>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that the rotations and the reflections are the only
          orthogonal transformations in <m>\RR^2</m>. (This one is a
          lot trickier than the previous proofs. Give it a shot, but
          don't distress too much if the approach is difficult to
          find.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This proof is substantially more difficult to approach than
          the three previous one. There are many transformations in
          <m>\RR^2</m>. I can't even just prove this for the five
          basic types, since there are complicated transformations
          that are combinations of the types and the combination might
          be orthogonal even when the pieces aren't. I need to find a
          trick or idea that lets me approach this.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea I thought to use was acting on the standard basis:
          <m>\{e_1, e_2\}</m>. Since these two vectors span all of
          <m>\RR^2</m>, if I know what happens to these two vectors,
          I know the entire transformation. First, the transformation does
          something to <m>e_1</m>, sending it to <m>Me_1</m>. Since
          length is preserved, this is some other unit vector. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Now where can <m>e_2</m> go? There are, in fact, only two
          choices. <m>Me_2</m> must also be a unit vector, since
          lengths are preserved. Also, angles are preserved, so the
          angle between the <m>Me_1</m> and <m>Me_2</m> must still be
          <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> (they are still perpendicular). That
          gives only two choices. If I face in the direction of
          <m>Me_2</m>, then I can have the unit vector pointing in
          the perpendicular direction to the right or to the left. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If <m>Me_2</m> is the perpendicular direction to the left,
          then <m>M</m> is a rotation. The relative positions of the
          two vectors are preserved and they are still unit vectors,
          so the are moved around the circle by whatever the angle is
          between <m>e_1</m> and <m>Me_1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If <m>Me_2</m> is the perpendicular direction to the right,
          then <m>M</m> is a reflection. This is a bit trickier to
          see, but the line of reflection will be the line halfway
          between <m>e_1</m> and <m>Me_1</m>. That line will flip
          <m>e_1</m> into <m>Me_1</m> by construction. But the flip
          will take anything perpendicular on the right and flip it to
          something perpendicular on the left. So <m>e_2</m>, which
          starts as the perpendicular vector on the right, ends up as
          the perpendicular direction on the left. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>M</m> must have one of these two behaviours, so <m>M</m>
          must be a rotation or a reflection.
