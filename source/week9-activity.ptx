      <statement>
        <p>
          Make a multiplication table for the dihedral group
          <m>D_5</m>. (Label the rotations <m>R_i</m>; the index
          <m>i</m> indicates how many fifth of a full turn for the
          rotation. Label the reflections <m>F_i</m>; the index
          indicates reflection over a line through the <m>i</m>
          vertex, counting counterclockwise. Then start calculating
          the compositions using vertex opertaions. One you have done
          a number of these, you can start looking for patterns in the
          multiplication table and potentially use those patterns to
          finish the table.)

        <p>
          There are many multiplications to calculate. I recommend
          calculating matrices by vertex operations. If I number the
          vertices of the pentagon counterclockwise from 1 to 5, then
          <m>R_2</m> (rotation by <m>\frac{2}{5}</m> of a turn) can be
          represented by this movement of vertices.

          Reflection <m>F_3</m> (reflection over the line through
          vertex 3 and the middle of the opposite edge)) can be
          represented by this action on the vertices.

          To calculate <m>R_2 \circ F_3</m>, I can use these vertex
          changes. In composition, I do the right transformation
          first. Therefore, starting at vertex 1, <m>F_3</m> send it
          to vertex 5, and then <m>R_2</m> sends vertex 5 to vertex 2.
          Therefore, the whole composition sends vertex 1 to vertex 2.
          I calculate the movement of the other four vertices
          similarly.

          </md>
          Then I have to identify this transformation, since is still
          should be something in the group. It cannot be a rotation,
          since vertex 4 is fixed. The only rotation that fixes vertex
          4 is <m>F_4</m>. Therefore, I have <m>R_2 \circ F_3 =
          F_4</m>. Note that the multiplication is not commutative. If
          I did <m>F_3 \circ R_2</m>, the result would be these vertex
          transformations.

          This is the reflection <m>F_2</m>, so <m>F_3 \circ R_2 =
          F_2</m>.  This is just a demonstration calculation: you'll
          have to many of these to produce the whole table. Between
          calculating compositions and using the patterns of the table
          to fill in remaining entries, you should end up with this
          multiplication for <m>D_5</m>.

        The only power of <m>x^4</m> in either of the two polynomials
        is in the first. Therefore, the only way to get 5x^4 in the

        The coefficient of <m>x^3</m> needs to be 2. The only way to

        I need to find three constants for this equation.

        </me>
        There is no <m>x^6</m> in the polynomial I want to build, not
        in any of the other terms. Therefore, <m>a=0</m> is the only
        possibility to get ride of the <m>x^6</m>. 
        <me>
          7x^5 - 7x^2 + 14 = b(x^5 + x^3) + c(x^3 +
          x^2 - 2)
        </me>
        Then to match the power of <m>x^5</m>, I need <m>b=7</m>. Let
        me put that in and see what it looks like. 
        <me>
          7x^5 - 7x^2 + 14 = 7x^5 + (7 + c)x^3 + cx^2 - 2c
        </me>
        Then to get <m>0</m> as the coefficient of <m>x^3</m>, I need
        c = -7
        <me>
          7x^5 - 7x^2 + 14 = 7x^5 + (7 - 7)x^3 - 7x^2 + 14 = 7x^5 -
          7x^2 + 14

        The remaining coefficients all work out, so <m>a = 0</m>, <m>b

        What is the dimension of <m>\Span \{ x^2 - 4, x, 4, x-1, x^2 +
        4x + 3 \}</m>. (You can do this algebraically, but it's better
        to try to argue from the standard basis of polynomials that I
        talked about in the notes and the video.) 
      </statement>
      <solution>
        The dimension is the number of linear independent polynomials
        that I need to make this span. I can use the fact, from the
        notes and the videos, that the monomials are enough to span
        the polynomials. I have <m>4</m>, <m>x</m> and <m>x^2 - 4</m>,
        which gets me the first three monoials (I can get <m>x^2</m>
        by subtracting <m>4</m> from <m>x^2 - 4</m>.) Between the
        first three monomials, nothing else is needed to make any
        degree 2 or less polynomials. Therefore, this span has
        dimension 3.

        What is the dimension of the set of all polynomials with
        degree 6 or less?
      </statement>
      <solution>
        Again, I'm going to use the monomials from the video. To get
        degree 6 polynomials, I need these monomials: <m>\{ 1, x, x^2,
        x^3, x^4, x^5, x^6 \}</m>. These are all linearly independent
        and their are seven of them. Therefore, the dimension of all
        polynomials with degree 6 or less is 7.

        What's the dimension of the set of all odd-degree polynomials?
      </statement>
      <solution>
        Since the odd degree are unbounded, this degree can be as high
        as I want. It includes all the monomials <m>\{x, x^3, x^5, x^7
        \ldots \}</m>. Since there are infinitely many of these
        monomials and they are all linearly independent, the dimension
        of the odd-degree polynomials is infinite. 
      </solution>

      <statement>
        <p>
          If the set <m>\{x^6, x^4, x^3, x^2, 4x^6 + 3x^4 - 9x^3 -
          4x^2 - 15\}</m> linearly independent?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The first four terms are different monomials, so they are
          independent. The real question here is the last polynomial.
          It has all the same monomials as the first four. The only
          different is the constant, <m>-15</m>. Does that make it
          independent? 
        </p>
        <p>
          It does make the last polynomials independent. Using the
          first first, I can build <m>4x^6 + 3x^4 - 9x^3 - 4x^2</m>,
          but there is no way that I can make a linear combination of
          the monomials and get the <m>-15</m>. I only get multiples
          of the powers -- linear combinations cannot add another
          constant. Therefore, the fifth polynomials is independent,
          and this whole set is a linearly independent set.
