    <title>Symmetry, Again</title>
    <p>
      A major theme of this course is symmetry. When I defined linear
      transformations, I defined them to be transformations that
      preserved something. Geometrically, they preserved linear
      subspaces: each linear subspace is sent to another linear
      subspace. Algebraically, they preserved the linear operations of
      addition and scalar multiplication: I can do vector addition or
      scalar multiplication before or after the transformation and the
      result is the same. This the general notion of symmetry that I
      want to develop in this course: transformations that preserve
      something (either algebraic or geometric). 
    </p>
    <p>
      This general idea of symmetry continues to develop as the course
      moves deeper into the discipline of linear algebra. The
      classification of matrices, at least geometrically, is almost
      always a question of symmetry.  In this section, I'm going to
      define some new classes of matrices in terms of their
      symmetries: <emdash/> in terms of what they preserve.

      Recall the notation I've already established for matrix sets
      and groups (with real coefficients).
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The set of <m>n \times m</m> matrices is written
            <m>M_{n,m}(\RR)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The set of square (<m>n \times n</m>) matrices is written
            <m>M_n(\RR)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The group of invertible matrices is called the general
            linear group and written <m>GL_n(\RR)</m> or
            <m>GL(n)</m>.
          </p>

    <title>Transformations that Preserve Size and Orientation</title>
    <p>
      Determinants measure two geometric properties: size and
      orientation. These are both potential symmetries. If a matrix
      has determinant <m>\pm 1</m>, I know that it preserves size. If
      a matrix has positive determinant, I know that it
      preserves orientation. If a matrix has determinant one,
      it preserves both.

          The group of matrices of determinant one with real
          coefficients is called the <term>Special Linear Group</term>
          and is written <m>SL_n(\RR)</m> or <m>SL(n)</m>.

          The group of orthogonal <m>n \times n</m> matrices is called
          the <term>Orthogonal Group</term> and is written
          <m>O_n(\RR)</m> or <m>O(n)</m>. The group of orthogonal
          matrices, which also preserve orientation (have determinant
          one) is called the <term>Special Orthogonal Group</term> and
          is written <m>SO_n(\RR)</m> or <m>SO(n)</m>.
